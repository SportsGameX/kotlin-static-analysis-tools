<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Config


This repo contains list of configs that can be added to your Kotlin project.

Here's why:
* Helps you learn best practice when writing code.
* Helps pick up on errors that could lead to problems down the road.
* Helps you write more readable and understandable code.

By no means is this the perfect solution, but it's a great start.

## Getting Started

#### Import kotlin-static-analysis-tools repo as submodule

First clone the config repository as a submodule. To do use the git code below:
```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/SportsGameX/kotlin-static-analysis-tools.git
```

*If step above is successful you should see **kotlin-static-analysis-tools** folder and **.gitmodules** were added to your project directory.*


#### Add kotlin-static-analysis-tools gradle script

This will add all included tools to the file or you can add indivually by going to [Included Tools](#included-tools) section below and selecting which tools you want.

1) Update your *project* build.gradle by adding the following based on your gradle language:
    ```sh
    // Groovy
    apply from: "kotlin-static-analysis-tools/static.analysis.gradle.kts"
    // Kotlin
    apply(from = "kotlin-static-analysis-tools/static.analysis.gradle.kts")
    ```

2) Sync and Build your project and detekt files should run automatically when you build.<br />**(note you won't be able to compile till you fix all detekt errors)**

#### Update config repo

If you have already cloned the project,and want to update with latest changes locally. To do use the git code below:
```sh
git submodule update --remote
```

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Included Tools

### Detekt

![Detekt logo][detekt-logo]

Static analysis of Kotlin files that helps us with analyzing code complexity, potential bugs, code smells, unhandled exceptions, and many other things

#### Adding just Detekt

1) Update your *project* build.gradle by adding the following:

  ```sh
  // Groovy
  apply from: "kotlin-static-analysis-tools/detekt/detekt.setup.gradle.kts"
  // Kotlin
  apply(from = "kotlin-static-analysis-tools/detekt/detekt.setup.gradle.kts")
  ```
Make sure to add to **BOTTOM** of file & should **NOT** be nested within any blocks

2) Sync and Build your project and detekt files should run automatically when you build.<br />**(note you won't be able to compile till you fix all detekt errors)**

  ---
### Ktlint

![Ktlint logo][ktlint-logo]

A static analyzer for Kotlin that automatically scans your code for any style, indentation, or line breaks that donâ€™t follow the official Kotlin style defined by Jetbrains.

#### Adding just Ktlint

1) Update your *project* build.gradle by adding the following:

  ```sh
  // Groovy (.gradle file)
  apply from: "kotlin-static-analysis-tools/ktlint/ktlint.setup.gradle.kts"
  // Kotlin (.gradle.kts file)
  apply(from = "kotlin-static-analysis-tools/ktlint/ktlint.setup.gradle.kts")
  ```
Make sure to add to **BOTTOM** of file & should **NOT** be nested within any blocks

2) Sync and Build your project and ktlint files should run automatically when you build.<br />**(note you won't be able to compile till you fix all ktlint errors)**
